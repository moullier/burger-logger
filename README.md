# Burger Logger

## Description

This project is a burger logger.  It takes input from the user and uses Node, Express and Handlebars to get and display the data.  A mySQL database is used to store the burger data. This project is structured using the MVC design pattern.  I generated an ORM object to organize the database queries programmatically.  The HTML is generated in Handlebars.
